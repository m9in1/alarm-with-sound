Hello. Its Project Alarm for Arty A7.

Features:
1. Its submodule for Pulpino, you can message with Alarm module from UART
2. Its have working 7-segment display
3. From UART you can set, reset alarm, time
4. This module have audio_pwm module, but sound is bad((



My plan:

1. Making first minimal modules, thinkig about future design
2. Making root modules, like second-counter.
3. Making additional modules, like Alarm-module, Sound-module
4. Check for it's all working(bad working for sound, try to fix it) 
5. Make APB-wrapper for future adding in Pulpino project
6. Make drivers

Right now its full working module
