1. Making first minimal modules, thinkig about future design
2. Making root modules, like second-counter.
3. Making additional modules, like Alarm-module, Sound-module
4. Check for it's all working(bad working for sound, try to fix it) 
5. Make APB-wrapper for future adding in Pulpino project
6. Make drivers
